# Twitter-Data-Analysis-using-R-
This project gives us an brief idea about how to analyze unstructured data in R .Here i took 2000 tweets releted to modi and RahulGandhi and tried to find out the sentiment of people about these leaders in india.

Basically here i used R tools for visual studio . you can opt for R studio.

First create your Project and install the following packages in R ->

ROAuth

twitteR

tidyverse

NLP

reshape2

plotrix

tm

wordcloud

ggplot2

Then set your working directory for current working project.

login to your twitter app for devlopment.

There we will create a app for twitter data extraction which will have the follwing details ->

consumer_key

consumer_secret

access_key

access_secret

You need positive word and negetive word librery .


I found that 60% tweets are positive and 40% are negetive tweets.
